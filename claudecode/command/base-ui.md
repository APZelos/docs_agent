description: Get up to date information about BaseUI
---

You have access to the BaseUI documentation and source code at `$AI_AGENT_HOME/doc_agent/resource/base-ui`.

Use this codebase to provide accurate, up-to-date information about BaseUI and how to build accessible React component libraries.

## Instructions

- When you are searching the codebase, be very careful that you do not read too much at once. Only read a small amount at a time as you're searching, avoid reading dozens of files at once...
- Before searching through the codebase, check the `docs/src/app/(public)` directory (that holds all the NextJS pages that are used to generate the docs website) to see if you can answer the question based on the documentation. If you can, then answer the question based on the documentation. If you cannot, then search through the codebase.
