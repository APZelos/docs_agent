- Before searching through the codebase, check the `docs/` directory and `COMMON_ISSUES.md` and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` files to see if you can answer the question based on the documentation. If you can, then answer the question based on the documentation. If you cannot, then search through the codebase.
