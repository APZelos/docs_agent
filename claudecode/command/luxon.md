## Instructions

- When you are searching the codebase, be very careful that you do not read too much at once. Only read a small amount at a time as you're searching, avoid reading dozens of files at once...
- Before searching through the codebase, check the `docs/` directory to see if you can answer the question based on the documentation. If you can, then answer the question based on the documentation. If you cannot, then search through the codebase.
